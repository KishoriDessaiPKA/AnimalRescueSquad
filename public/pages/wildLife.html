	<p>In the  hinterlands and deep villages of Goa, many times wild animals such as snakes,  reptiles like crocodiles and wild cats like tigers are loved or hated by  humans. </p>
    <p><strong>Crocodile </strong> </p>
    <p>Mugger  crocodiles in Goa exist in two populations one in Opa River and another in the  brackish waters of Cumbarjua Canal. The Crocodylus  Palustris of the Cumbarjua breed is unique, as the muggers are freshwater  crocodiles that have adapted to the saline mangrove eco-system- an achievement  nowhere else found in India. Wandering crocodiles have been spotted at Chorao,  Thivim, Siolim and Carambolim. The Syngenta freshwater lakes at Corlim have a  small number of 13 crocodiles thriving. </p>
    <p>Crocodile  worship is practiced in some parts of Goa. Every year on the day of the new  moon in January a ceremony called the 'Mannge Thapnee' is performed. People  construct a crocodile from silt, shells are placed as eyes and scales and  sticks for teeth. <img src="images/threatSpecies//wildlife_clip_image001.jpg" alt="crocodile" width="200" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="5" align="right">The crocodile is then adorned with flowers and vermillion. A  live chick is offered as a sacrifice and placed in a depression. The crocodile  is believed to be a guardian deity or protector.

    <p><strong>Snakes </strong> </p>
    <p>Nag Panchami is the day marked  for the veneration of snakes. In Hindu mythology, the cobra has a special  significance and the earth, it is believed, rests on the head of 'Shesha' - the  thousand-hooded cobra. It is a festival in the honor of the Snake God, Shesha  Nag. On this day of Nag Panchami Hindu Goans worship the snake by offering milk  and doing Puja. According to the Hin<img src="images/threatSpecies//wildlife_clip_image002.jpg" alt="cobra" width="200" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="5" align="left">du calendar, Nag Panchami is celebrated in  the month of Shravan (July-August). During the rains when the snakes appear out  of the pit they are worshipped as they guard crops from getting spoiled by rats  and other rodents.</p>
    <p><strong>Turtles</strong> </p>
    <p>Olive  Ridley"s Turtles (Lepidochelys Olivacea) are regularly spotted along the  coastline of Goa. There has been decline in the  population of Olive Ridley due to human activities. This prompted the Indian  Government to launch the National Sea Turtle Conservation Project in 1981.The  Forest department of Goa started the Turtle Conservation Programme from the  year 1996. Presently in Goa only Olive Ridley turtles are nesting in  significant numbers on Goa's beaches. Olive Ridley Turtle is one of the  smallest of sea turtles with adult reaching to 2-2.5 feet in length and  weighing 40-55.5 kg. The diet of Olive Ridley includes crabs, shrimps, rock  lobsters, jelly fish and tunicates. The female produce up to 100 eggs during  nesting. The incubation of eggs takes about 40-50 days and the newly hatched  larvae return back to sea after hatching. Morjim in North Goa, Galgibag and  Agonda in South Goa are the three main nesting sites of the Oliv<img src="images/threatSpecies//wildlife_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Olive Ridley's Turtles" width="200" height="150" hspace="15" vspace="5" align="right">e Ridley"s  in Goa.</p>
    <p>Other  nesting sites where sporadic nesting takes place are at Kerim, Harmal and  Ashvem in Pernem Taluka; Anjuna and Calangute-Candolim in Bardez Taluka;  Velsao, Senarbatim, Colva, Benaulim and Betul in Salcete Taluka; and Patnem,  Palolem and Kindlem beaches in Canacona Taluka. The success of the conservation  effort has boosted eco-tourism in these areas.</p>
    <p><strong>Tigers </strong> </p>
    <p>Evidence of at least three  tigers' presence has been found in Goa's wildlife sanctuaries during the  ongoing wildlife census in the state by forest department officials. The  development is a shot in the arm for green activists who have been lobbying for  Goa's forest areas being declared as tiger reserves. </p>
