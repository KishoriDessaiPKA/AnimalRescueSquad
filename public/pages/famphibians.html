Goa has a large reptilian/amphibian population. This includes the ubiquitous common house gecko, the chameleon, a variety of frogs and the rare monitor lizard. Two species of crocodile are mostly found along the banks of a few inland waterways. Freshwater turtles and rare marine turtles like the Olive Ridley, which come ashore between October and December to lay their eggs in the sand are also found in Goa.
